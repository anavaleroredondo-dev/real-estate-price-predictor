# Real Estate Price Predictor

## Overview
This project implements a Machine Learning model to predict real estate prices based on property features using **Linear Regression**. The goal is to understand the relationship between variables like square footage, number of rooms, and the final market price.

## Business Problem
Real estate agencies often struggle with manual valuations that are prone to human bias. This tool aims to provide a data-driven baseline for pricing properties, reducing estimation errors and saving time for agents.

## Tech Stack
* **Python 3.x**
* **Scikit-Learn** (Model building)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (Data manipulation)
* **Matplotlib** (Data visualization)

## Key Results
* Implemented **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression**.
* Visualized the "Actual vs. Predicted" price distribution.
* Achieved high interpretability by analyzing model coefficients (w).

## How to Run
1.  Open the notebook in Google Colab (link above).
2.  Run all cells to generate the synthetic dataset and train the model.
